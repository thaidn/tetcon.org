        <title>tetcon.org is now HTTPS only</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I still remember the first certificate that I ordered from Verisign costed a few thousand dollars. The verification process took several weeks and a lot of paperwork. I even had to scan and send Verify my employer's operating license. It was such a bad experience and so expensive that I thought I would never run SSL on my personal sites, until I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://sslmate.com&quot;&gt;SSLMate&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago. Woah! I just need to run a command to buy a certificate that is accepted by all browsers for only 15 bucks/year - as the saying goes it's even cheaper than a bowl of pho! Of course I get what I pay for, some browsers won't even show a green bar, but security-wise tetcon.org and its users get as much protection as www.google.com. Below is the configuration I used for my nginx web server - it's rated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=tetcon.org&quot;&gt;A+&lt;/a&gt; by the SSL Labs:

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
  server {
    listen   80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name tetcon.org www.tetcon.org;
    ssl_certificate     www.tetcon.org.chained.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key www.tetcon.org.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers &quot;EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+RC4 EECDH EDH+aRSA RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS !RC4&quot;;
    if ($ssl_protocol = &quot;&quot;) {
       rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;
    }
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains';
    add_header Public-Key-Pins 'max-age=3600; pin-sha256=&quot;Cm7n+dyRY9t97OOp3nIdI1sBq5U1BZfO+Y5WecBFgB0=&quot;; pin-sha256=&quot;k+4a7obu5IVsq0xaxDrzBSjPO0eNapo4x0xlahj3tlY=&quot;; includeSubDomains';
    ...
  }
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS is hard, let's go hacking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Better late than never! I am excited to announce that TetCon Saigon 2015 will be held at Hotel Majestic Saigon on 6 January 2015. We will start selling tickets in a few days. Please watch this website for more announcements (or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinsang.net&quot;&gt;Tin Sang&lt;/a&gt;, if you are one of the three people including me and my cat that still read it).
&lt;/p&gt;

Re post title: no, I lied. CSS is easy to learn. I've done that 7 times, since 2007.
&lt;/p&gt;
