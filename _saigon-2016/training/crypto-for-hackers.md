date: December 29-30, 2015
trainers:
  - Thai Duong
intended-audience: penetration testers, security engineers, crypto enthusiasts, software developers

software-requirements: Python 2.7 with PyCrypto installed 
description: "This 2-day course will teach the foundation you need to become a crypto engineer that can identify and exploit crypto misuses as well as design and implement crypto protocols correctly. Topics include, but not limited to, introduction to crypto, top bad ideas in crypto and how to exploit them for fun and profit, and protocol design and analysis.

The first day will introduce the primary goal (and the limitation) of crypto, and the tools and techniques to achieve it. We will cover history of crypto, probabilistic encryption, randomness generators, symmetric-key crypto and public-key crypto. If time permits, we will cover the math of crypto as well as explore advanced topics such as elliptic curve crypto. The second day will cover top misuses of the primitives introduced on the first day. We will cover the most popular problems that we have seen in real-world applications. Even if the primitives are used correctly individually, combining them together in form of a crypto protocol could introduce very subtle vulnerabilities. On the last day, we will find and exploit vulnerabilities in popular user authentication protocols and various versions of SSL. Finally, we will design a protocol that meets the goal stated on the first day."
