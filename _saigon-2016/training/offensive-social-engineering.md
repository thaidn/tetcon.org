description: "Offensive Social Engineering is a two-day training course focused on advanced social engineering techniques. Social Engineering is discussed in both theory and practice: starting from the history of the discipline, the students are introduced to the basic psychological principles abused during Social Engineering attacks; the inner workings of the so-called Human OS are then detailed, thus providing the class a clear understanding of theoretical concepts that can be adopted during the practical design of attack scenarios. Finally, an agile and highly practical SE methodology is provided together with a series of real-world cases studies “dissection” sessions, which are used to better understand the key aspects of successful SE attacks"
