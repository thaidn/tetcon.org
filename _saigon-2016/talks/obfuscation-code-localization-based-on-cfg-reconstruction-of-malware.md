description:
  - "This talk presents a tool BE-PUM (Binary Emulator for Pushdown Model generation), which generates a precise control flow
graph (CFG), under presence of typical obfuscation techniques of malware, e.g., indirect jump, self-modification, overlapping instructions, and structured exception handler (SEH), which cover packers. Experiments are performed on 2000 real-world malware examples taken from VX Heaven and compare the results of a popular commercial disassembler IDA Pro, a state-of-the-art tool JakStab, and BE-PUM. It shows that BE-PUM correctly traces CFGs, whereas IDA Pro and JakStab fail. By manual inspection on 300 malware examples, we also observe that the starts of these failures exactly locate the entries of obfuscation code."
