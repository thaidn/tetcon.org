description:
  - "DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection vulnerability that results from unsafe dynamic code generation in JavaScript applications. Unfortunately, few practical defenses have been presented. This work proposes a remedy to the problem at hand. Our solution - DEXTERJS - is capable of transparently auto-patching such vulnerabilities while incurring an acceptable overhead. Extensive experiments on a quarter million URLs have shown the robustness and scalability of DEXTERJS."
