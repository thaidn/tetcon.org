description:
  - "CPU emulator is a program emulating the internal operations of a physical CPU in software. CPU emulator plays a vital role and has a lot of applications in computer security area, including but not limited to reversing, malware analysis, vulnerability detection and exploit development. However, all the available CPU emulators have fundamental issues and proved unsuitable for modern security tools."
  - "To answer to the demands on a good CPU emulator, we have designed & implemented Unicorn engine. This talk will introduce the architecture and the challenges of building Unicorn, together with the latest development of our framework. The audience will understand the advantages of this engine and see why the future is assured, so that Unicorn will keep getting better, stronger and become the emulator engine of choice for the security community."
  - "Unicorn is to lay the ground for innovative works. We will present some new advanced tools built on top of Unicorn - with live demo - to demonstrate its power, so the audience can see how our engine can open up new opportunities for future of security research & development."
  - "Unicorn is already released with full source code at the address http://www.unicorn-engine.org."
