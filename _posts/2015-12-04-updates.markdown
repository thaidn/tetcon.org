It's somewhat unexpected, but a very nice man, perhaps a regular reader of this blog, has helped us secure a deal with Sheraton, the marvelous 5-star hotel right at the heart of Saigon. Tickets will be on sale tomorrow.

If you want to submit to TetCon, please do it now. The CFP will end by the end of this week.

<p>If you want to take one of the training classes, please sign up now. We need at least 10 attendants per class; otherwise we have to cancel because we can't cover the cost.
