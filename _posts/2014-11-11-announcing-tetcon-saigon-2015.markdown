Better late than never! I am excited to announce that TetCon Saigon 2015 will be held at Hotel Majestic Saigon on 6 January 2015. We will start selling tickets in a few days. Please watch this website for more announcements (or visit <a href="http://tinsang.net">Tin Sang</a>, if you are one of the three people including me and my cat that still read it).

Re post title: no, I lied. CSS is easy to learn. I've done that 7 times, since 2007.
