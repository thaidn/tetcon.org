Phew! I'm excited to announce that the final <a href="https://tetcon.org/saigon-2016/schedule/index.html">program</a> of TetCon 2016 has been released. It'll be a packed day full of hackers and security researchers who will show you how to find 0-days in Microsoft Edge, to break Android phones, or to build your own security tools. 
</p>

<p>
We'll have 10 talks (out of 20 submissions.) We know it's insane to pack so much content in a single day -- next year I'll try to make this a two-day event -- but just come and see, and you'll understand why we chose these talks. 
</p>

<p>
Happy holidays and see you all at Sheraton Saigon a few weeks from now!
