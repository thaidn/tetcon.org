I'm so excited to announce that the review board, after much debate, has finally agreed on the <a href="https://tetcon.org/saigon-2015/schedule/index.html">schedule</a> of TetCon Saigon 2015. Woohoo! Check it out and note the talks you want to see, but I think all of them are pretty interesting.

<p>
We will have two turbo and seven full talks, which are roughly divided in three sessions: web security in the morning, trendy technologies (OMG!! Bitcoin!?) after lunch break, and low-level reverse engineering and exploitation the rest of the day. And I'm sorry, but no, we won't have any female speaker this year.

See you all at Majestic this Tuesday :-).
