title: Breaking Mifare Ultralight, a journey in transportation systems NFC world
description: NFC is growing around us. In several EU, US and Asia countries Mifare
             Ultralight cards have been adopted as standard for cheap single-ride
             or multiple-rides tickets for transport systems. In the past year
             I've studied and successfully exploited three different types of
             vulnerabilities in these systems. In this talk I will demostrate
             how an abuser can easily get free rides in a transport system,
             just using his/her NFC-enabled smartphone; moreover, I'll show
             that it is also possible to forge (and sell) tickets very cheaply.
