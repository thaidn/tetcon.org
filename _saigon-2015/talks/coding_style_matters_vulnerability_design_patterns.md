description:
  - "In current era of exploitation it is comming more complex to develop even PoC for vulnerability, especially when it comes to more complicated one, like race conditions, kernel sandbox escapes... And it seems that nowdays is still quite common write concept of exploitability for vendors, or even final code, in prehistoric way, and even using shellcoding. We will show how vulnerability “design patterns” transform hacky way of writting code to developing software wich breaks another one. We believe that developing is the way to go, for improving vulnerability assasement, for sake of security and your own time."
