description:
  - 2014 witnessed a tremendous growth of anonymous messaging. Apps like Secret, Whisper, or Yik Yak have attracted tens of millions of users, and have raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Studies have shown that, however, none of these apps offer true anonimity. For example, none of them use anything like Tor to anonymize communications, and they actually collect ton of personally identifiable information. The app providers claim that they can't know the identity of their users, but technically they can deanoymize anyone if they want to. What could an app do to make the claim of "can't know" into a reality? I've tried to answer this billion-dollar question for some time. In this talk I'll present what I've learned so far, and introduce an experimental design of a high-latency mobile mix network that may or may not work.
