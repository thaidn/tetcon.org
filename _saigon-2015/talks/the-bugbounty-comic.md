description:
  - "Bug bounty programs are becoming an increasingly popular method of finding security bugs on the Internet. Google, Facebook, and Yahoo! have been running such programs for several years. In Vietnam, BKAV is the first and only company that has open a bug bounty program since 2010. In this talk, I will show my experiences and strategy in finding bugs, communicating, reporting, consulting or blaming the vendors. My talk includes “the good, the bad, and the ugly” case studies of real world #bugbounty programs."
