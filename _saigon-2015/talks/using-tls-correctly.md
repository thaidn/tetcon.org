description:
  - "SSL/TLS is the most important security protocol on the Internet. It has been deployed in Vietnam and worldwide to protect financial transactions, personal data, and other sensitive information. Unfortunately, I found that many systems, especially in Vietnam, are using the protocol incorrectly. In this talk, I will present the common SSL/TLS issues found at major banks and payment gateways in Vietnam, even though most of them are spending thousands of dollars per year on certificates. I will show how to fix the issues, and get an A+ rating from Qualys SSL Lab, and be as secure as www.google.com or www.facebook.com with a budget as little as $15/year."
