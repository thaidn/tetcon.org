description:
  - In this talk I will present an attack in Bitcoin pooled mining namely Block Withholding (BWH) attack, which allows dishonest miners to gain more reward that they should do regardless of their computing power and the pool size. This is surprising since the earlier common intuition in Bitcoin community is that the BWH attack does not financially make sense.

  - To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the attack both analytically and empirically.
