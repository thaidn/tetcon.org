  - "Malware attack across multiple platforms is an interesting new trend in information security in recent years. Some notorious mobile malware including Xsser, Cloud Atlas, FinFisher show us that without security awareness and cyber security knowledge, all our devices could be infected sooner or later. In this talk, we present the analysis of Xsser/fake-Code4HK Android trojan and iOS RAT by reverse engineering its malicious code and functionalities. A quick introduction to Android and iOS reverse engineering with JEB and IDA is also presented to help reverse engineers and malware analysts dive into these interesting areas. Reverse engineering protected Android apps and iOS applications should be in the must-have skills of reverse engineers, application security engineers and forensic analysts in the modern days."
