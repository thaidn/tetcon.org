description:
  - Local Microsoft security policies are one of the few areas of security that are rarely researched or focused on by the security community. These policies are designed to prevent local users from accessing functionality which has been "Disabled By Your Administrator". From Local Group Policy, Software Restriction Policies, App Locker to Internet Explorer, each Microsoft technology has its own way of restricting what you can and cannot do. For local exploitation attempt these technologies can be troublesome, frustrating and restrict the true potential of your attack. This talk will cover a broad view of the current attacks against Microsoft local policies and the underlying issues affecting this form of security.
